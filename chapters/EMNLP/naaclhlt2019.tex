\chapter{Synthetic Pairs for Multilingual Grounded Language Learning}
\label{ch:EMNLP}

\paragraph{abstract}

Recent work has highlighted the advantage of jointly learning grounded sentence representations 
from multiple languages. 
However, the data used in these studies has 
been limited to an \emph{aligned} scenario, in which
the same images are annotated with sentences 
in multiple languages. In this paper, we focus on the more realistic 
\emph{disjoint} scenario using English and German
image--caption data sets where the images
do not overlap between languages. 
We observe that training with aligned data provides larger gains than training with disjoint data, which may be caused by the lack of coherence between the disjoint data sets. 
%\todo{The problem that we solve is not cross-domain is just the lack
%of alignment.}
To address the lack of coherence, we propose a
\emph{pseudopairing} method, in which we create \emph{synthetically aligned} 
English--German--Image triplets from the disjoint sets. The pseudopairs are created in a two-step process:
first we train a model on the 
\emph{disjoint} data, then we create novel pairs across data sets using sentence similarity 
under the learned model.
Experiments show that the pseudopair method improves 
image--sentence retrieval performance, 
%both when \emph{aligned} and \emph{disjoint} sets are available, 
%or when there are only \emph{disjoint} sets, 
despite requiring no external training data or models. 
We do find, however, that using an external machine translation model to generate the synthetic data sets results
in better performance.
