\subsection{Pseudopairs or translations?}

The results in Section~\ref{sec:pseudo} show that our pseudopair 
method consistently improves performance compared to training on disjoint data, however, it is vastly
outperformed by the translation approach. In the \emph{disjoint}
setting with the synthetic translated data, the model achieves a 335.5 Sum-of-Recall-scores, while with pseudopair data, the best performance is only 322.9. The difference is similarly
large in the \emph{aligned plus disjoint} case, with the best result of 742.4 Sum-of-Recall-scores for the translated data, and only 728.2 for the pseudopair method.
\todo[inline]{We should try to draw some conclusions from these results. What does it mean for practical applications in the realistic scenario? Is the power of the pseudopair method limited by the size of the disjoint dastasets?}
