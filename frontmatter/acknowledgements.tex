\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

%Completing this thesis is an unpleasant experience.
%You see, a limitation of mine is the inability to view stuff around me as stationary
%things, rather, I tend to see everything as processeses.
%Never managed to grasp the idea that there are moments that have passed,
%that there is the ``right now'' and that there is a future to look forward to.
%The ``starting'' and ``finishing'' of this work is imposed upon me
%by convention and to be honest it was very challenging.
%%My projects started from the desire to do something and were turned into
%%finished papers, because that is how we do things.
%Anyhow, now you are here reading the start of the end of this chapter of mine
%so I should try to put some nice words here. Don't get me wrong,
%I do understand that now is the time to move on to first thank my supervisors
%then my family followed by my colleagues and then finish up with perhaps a bit
%cryptic and personal messages to some special others. My problem is that I
%feel like I was always very open about my appretiation, greatfulness, criticism
%and disregard. I am not sure what there is to say for me here that I have not
%said to You in person. Furthermore, I handle formalities incredibly poorly.
%To my supervisors I
%would say that they did a much better job than a lot of others. Authoring
%a message to my family here seems a bit useless to me.
%I also hope that the people I love are not going
%go through the struggle of reading any of this stuff. I'm clearly not a
%great writer and the topic of my thesis is very tangental to the lives of the
%vast majority. As it is obvious by now I personally fail to see
%the epic significance of this \LaTeX document and I will continue anyway to
%indulge in my relationships with the wonderful human beings who share their
%lives with me.
